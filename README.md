# Disneyland-Reviews

## Project Objective

This project analyzes reviews of three Disneyland parks (Disneyland Hong Kong, Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland California) over several decades. Using Tableau for visualization and data analytics, we will explore sentiment analysis of the reviews, identify trends over time, and assess ratings for each park to uncover the key factors influencing these ratings.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Explore Customer Preferences:
    - Identify which park has the highest number of reviews and which has the highest ratings
    - Analyze the percentage distribution of star ratings for each park and the distribution of parks based on star ratings
2. Examine Review Locations:
    - Explore the geographic distribution of reviews
    - Determine average star rating per location
3. Identify Temporal Trends:
    - Conduct a time analysis to identify patterns in ratings throughout the year and across different months.
4. Provide Data-Driven Insights:
    - Generate insights to optimize Disneylandâ€™s performance based on customer reviews.
